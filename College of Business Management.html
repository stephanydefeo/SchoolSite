<h3><i>History</i></h3>
<p>When Baguio Colleges Foundation opened its door in July 1946 to the youth of Baguio and the Cordilleras, 156 students enrolled in courses in Engineering, Education, Liberal Arts, Law and Commerce.</p>
<p>It was in 1950 that four-year Bachelor of Science in Commerce (BSC) was granted government recognition. In the same year a lone graduate received the BSC degree. From 53 students in 1946, enrolment grew in the succeeding years by leaps and bounds. There were 106 Commerce enrollees in 1950 and continued to increase. By 1960, enrolment rose to 277 students and reached the thousand mark in 1970 at 1,038 enrollees.</p>
<p>In 1961, the Junior Secretarial Science Course (JSC) and the General Clerical Course (GCC) earned the school government recognition. Later, the Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA) was offered and had the first graduate in 1978. There were 20 graduates conferred with the degree in 1996 adding to a total of 233 (BSSA) holders. Responding to modern technology, the department offered the two-year Computer Secretarial with government recognition, issued in 1993.</p>
<p>In January 1990, former DECS Secretary Isidro D. Cariño issued DECS Order No. 5 s. 1990 phasing out the accounting major in BSC, BSBA and BBA courses and adopting in its place a separate course, Bachelor of Science in Accountancy (BSA).</p>
<p>The purpose of the DECS Order is to address the need for a professional identity for accounting education. The aim is to provide means for students to acquire knowledge, proficiency and intellectual abilities of providing service, which the public needs and the capacity to grow and develop into fully qualified professional accountants.</p>
<p>The first batch of graduates under this new thrust of accounting education totaled to 25 students. About four of these graduates took the CPA Board Examinations. The Accountancy program has attracted about 900 enrollees for the first semester of school-year 1996-1997.</p>
<p>In order to address the specific needs of the students, the college was divided into two, the College of Accountancy (CoA) and the College of Business Administration (CBA) effective school year 2001-2002</p>
<p>It was in school year 2003-2004 that the College of Business Administration (CBA) offered a program in Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management which eventually became a separate college in school year 2005-2006</p>
<p>The college reaffirms its continuous commitment towards service not only to the students but also to the community at large and the nation as a whole. The leadership and dedication of the deans steered the course of the college. Among those who served as deans were Luz-Diokno Yandok, Maximo Rayela, Felix Dueñas, Vicente Bareng, Jr., Pedro Tagudar Sr., Victor Punsalan, Alfonso Maniago and Primitivo Bambao. The late seventies and eighties saw the stints of Marieta Paragas, Jesus Benjamin Salvosa, Leonardo dela Cruz, Alfred-Jose Herbolario, Hermenigildo Cruz, Corazon Concepcion, Evelyn Tagudar, Saturnino Y. Ebusca.</p>
<p>Deans Narciso Pascua, Evelyn C. Pineda, and Leonarda R. Aguinalde brought the college to greater heights during the mid 90s up to school year 2007-2008. In school year 2008-2009 up to present, the deanship is held by Rhodora A. Ngolob.</p>
<p>CBA offers programs in Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA), Office Management (OM) and Entrepreneurship to prepare students for their respective careers. The BSBA Program are recognized and are officially accredited by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU).</p>
<p>The college with its unwavering commitment to quality education towards global competitiveness partnered with Australian Trade Training College-North Brisbane in school year 2010-2011, in order to provide a competency-based business education to future successful business practitioners here in the country and the world.</p>

<h3><i>Values</i></h3>
<p>Further, the college aims to instill the following values to all CBA students.</p>
<h3><i>Commitment to Excellence</i></h3>
<p>Every CBA student is expected to do his/her best in everything he/she does. The student should continually strive to become better every day and to work hard and be the best in every situation under all circumstances.</p>
<center><blockquote><i>"Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit." 
<strong>- Aristotle</strong></i></blockquote></center>
<h3><i>Be Respectful</i></h3>
<p>Every CBA student is expected to be respectful at all times. He/she should respect the dignity of all persons and the opinion and property of others.</p>
<center><blockquote><i>"Respect your fellow human being, treat them fairly, disagree with them honestly, enjoy their friendship, explore your thoughts about one another candidly, work together for a common goal and help one another achieve it."
<strong>- Bill Bradley</strong></i></blockquote></center>
<center><blockquote><i>"As we grow as unique person, learn to respect the uniqueness of others"
<strong>- Robert H. Schuller</strong></i></blockquote></center>
<h3><i>Academic History</i></h3>
<p>Every CBA student is expected to maintain the highest standards of academic integrity. Student's ignorance is not an excuse for academic dishonesty.</p>
<p>Academic dishonesty includes misrepresentation, lying, cheating, stealing and using unauthorized materials on any assignment, quiz, exam and other academic requirements.</p>
<center><blockquote><i>"Each time you are honest and conduct yourself with honesty, a success force will drive you toward greater success. Each time you lie, even with a little white lie, there are strong forces pushing you toward failure."
<strong>- Joseph Sugarman</strong></i></blockquote></center>
