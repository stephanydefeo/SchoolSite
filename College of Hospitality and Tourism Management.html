<h3><i>History</i></h3>
<p>The HRM and Tourism programs of UC started with 275 students under the College of Business Administration, headed by Dr. Leonarda R. Aguinlade. It was in September 2003 when Mr. Isagani A. Paddit was hired by the school as the first HRMT teacher and became the Department Head. The following term, new HRMT teachers were hired to meet the faculty requirements of the department.</p>
<p>In its second year, the department started showing its prowess in HRMT related competitions. As a result, the enrollment continued to increase. On March 22, 2005, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED-CAR) granted its government recognitions to Bachelor of Science in Tourism and Bachelor of Science in Hotel, Restaurant Management of UC.</p>
<p>In September 2005, the College of Hotel,Restaurant Management & Tourism (CHRMT) was recognized as a separate college upon the recommendation of Dean Leonarda Aguinalde and the approval of the Board of Trustees under the deanship of Mr. Isagani Paddit.</p>
<p>CHRMT became one of the flagships of the University of the Cordilleras in providing academic excellence and trainings validated by its increasing population, attributed to the performance of its students during competitions and the adoption of the Ladderized Programs in BS Tourism and BS HRM. The Ladderized Program was part of the initiative of the President of the Philippines under E.O. 358 mandating CHED and TESDA to integrate its best practices in quality education. UC-CHRMT is proud to be the first among the universities in Baguio to adopt the Ladderized Education Program (LEP) in BSHRM and BST where Dean Paddit was part of the Technical Working Group (TWG) in the realization of such curriculum adopted by CAR and Region 1.</p>
