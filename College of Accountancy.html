<h3><i>History</i></h3>
<p>The College of Accountancy of the University of the Cordilleras was created in June 2001, accepting the responsibility for the management of the Bachelor of Science in Accountancy (BSA) program from the College of Commerce which was renamed College of Business Administration.</p>
<p>The purpose of the establishment of the College of Accountancy was to elevate the quality of education of UC accountancy students and to improve the performance of the University in the licensure examination for Certified Public Accountants.</p>
<p>The first Dean of the College was Dr. Saturnino Y. Ebusca who served from SY 2001- 02 to SY 2002-03. He was followed by Ms. Rosa M. Allado, from SY 2003-04 to 2004-05 and then by Mr. Ramsay M. Colorado from SY 2005-06 to SY 2010-11. The current Dean is Dr. Felipe G. Balingit, Jr. who is also the Internal Auditor of the University.</p>
<p>In addition to its BSA program, the College started to operate the Bachelor of Science in Financial and Management Accounting (BSFMA) program in June 2004. A third program, the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology (BSAcT) was offered starting June 2010.</p>
<p>Because the College operates in the trimester system, BSFMA and BSAcT are 3-year programs while the BSA program can be finished in four years. In addition, because of the commonality of courses in the first years of the programs, BSA students have an opportunity to obtain two degrees in four years: BSA plus BSFMA or BSAcT.</p>
<p>The performance of the College in the Accountancy licensure examinations has continued to improve over the years, with its passing rate continuously exceeding the national passing average. The College has also produced CPA topnotchers.</p>
