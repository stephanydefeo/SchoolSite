<p>The College of Criminal Justice Education, adhering to the UC Philiosophy, recognizes the vital role in enhancing relevant and responsive education in the field of Criminology.</p>

<h3><i>History</i></h3>
<p>The College of Criminal Justice Education (CCJE) at the University of the Cordilleras (UC) traces its birth in the year 1986 when the school was then called Baguio Colleges Foundation (BCF). Back then, the College was under the umbrella of the College of Arts and Sciences known as Criminology Department. This Department offered the four-year degree Bachelor of Science in Criminology initially with 72 enrollees. With this degree program offering, UC (BCF) became an alternative Higher Education Institution in Baguio City for students in the Cordilleras and nearby regions who aim to pursue the degree program BS Criminology.
</p>
In 1990, the pioneer graduates of the degree program and first successful examinees in the Licensure Examination for Criminologists were produced. In the succeeding years, enrollees in BS Criminology continue to multiply; hence, in May of 1997 the Criminology Department under the late Dean, Dr. Benjamin G. Mang-usan was separated from the College of Arts and Sciences and became an independent College called the College of Criminology. The College was then housed at the 4th floor of the main building before it transferred to its present location; the towering science building.</p>

<p>The exemplary performance of the College in board examinations commenced during its early stages. Graduates of the College started to land in the ten (10) places as early as October of 1992, barely two years after the degree program was offered. In October of 1993, the first graduate to land in the number one spot emerged. Since then, graduates of the College managed to take the top ten (10) and twenty (20) places in the Licensure Examination for Criminologists. Furthermore, it consistently maintained its superior passing percentage way above the national passing rate.</p>

<p>In March 2002, the College was able to achieve one of its highest overall passing percentage in the Licensure Examination with a rating of 98%.</p>

<p>In 2005, specifically second trimester of SY 2005-2006, the College of Criminology was renamed the College of Criminal Justice Education by virtue of Academic Affairs Council Resolution No. 002, s.2005. This is in view of the issuance of CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 21 s. of 2005, which provides:</p>
<p><i>"A rationalized Criminal Justice Education (CJE) in the country that shall include degree programs in Criminology, Law Enforcement Administration, Correctional Administration, Industrial Security Administration and Forensic Science among others."</i></p>
<p>With the College's sincerity and genuine effort to provide quality education in the field of Criminology by "demonstrating excellence in providing quality instruction, research, extension and linkages and institutional qualifications", the Commission on Higher Education identified and designated the University of the Cordilleras as Center of Excellence (COE) in Criminology on October 9, 2008.</p>
<p>Then in April 2011, the College was able to attained 100% passing rate for first takers. Also, and worthy of note, the University was the only "Top Performing School" recognized by the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) in the April 2010 and April 2011 Licensure Examinations as per Commission Resolution No. 2010-547 series of 2010.</p>
<p>With these achievements in the Criminology Licensure Examinations, the College did not end its quest for excellence. Hence, in October 2012 and April 2013 , UC-CCJE obtained a commanding 100% passing rate. On top of this, UC-CCJE mounted a record of having 9 topnotchers in the top 10 places in the April 2013 Licensure examinations namely" 1st place, 2nd place, 3rd place, 4th place, 5th place, 7th place,, two 9th placers, and 10th place.</p>
<p>Consequently, as of April 2013, there are 116 topnotchers in the top ten (10) and twenty (20) places and with 8 placers. Furthermore, for the 32nd Criminology Licensure Examinations, the University of the Cordilleras sustains its reputation as the school with the highest passing percentage in the Criminology Licensure Examinations.</p>
<p>The current faculty and staff of the College of Criminal Justice Education continues to strive to uphold its status guided by the ideals, principles and standards of the late Dean Mang-usan that lingers in the halls of the University. His legacy to UC is an unmatched and unparalleled record of academic distinction in Criminology.</p>
