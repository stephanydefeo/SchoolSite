<h3><i>History</i></h3>
<p>The Baguio Colleges Foundation had made a victory torch to tertiary education after its birth on June 19, 1946. It universally catered to students coming from and outside the Cordilleras which resulted to producing top and capable graduates who, up to this date, have contributed to the development of society. The quality training, outstanding qualification of faculty, highly motivated students, adequate facilities, exemplary performance of graduates, among others, have further lifted the university to be granted its Deregulated Status by the Commission on Higher Education in October, 2001.</p>

Delos Santos, Ms. Judith Odanee G. Magwilang, Dr. Mario G. Imson and Dr. Ma. Geraldine A. La Madrid.</p>
<p>The increasing influx of students enrolling in the College of Nursing prompted the university to restructure the Legarda Building in January, 2004. Students who enrolled major nursing subjects were then accommodated in the Legarda Building and those with minor and laboratory subjects were housed in the main campus at Governor Pack Road. In June 2005, faculty and students under Levels I and III transferred to the main campus leaving behind Level II at the Legarda Building.</p>
<p>School year 2004 - 2005 also marked the transition period in the implementation of the BSN program from trimester to semestral regular program. After CHED and RQAT visits, the college obtained its Level 1, 2 and 3 permit and later the recognition in 2005 with Government Recognition # 018 s. 2005 issued by the Commission on Higher Education</p>

<p>School Year 2005 - 2006 was the start of the implementation of the regular 4 - year BSN program under Dean Catalina B. Alinduza. Finally, all levels of the college were accommodated in the main campus in November 2005. The transfer of the college to the new 12 - storey building in January 2006 further enticed many students to enroll in nursing. Initially, there were two (2) department heads and thirty (30) faculty members, which gradually increased to seventy five (75) and now, one hundred and seventy (170). With its major focus on classroom, clinical and community instruction, linkages and networking, the dean has been working in partnership with the office of the academic affairs, administration, finance, the registrar, other colleges and with the four (4) department heads, two (2) clinical coordinators, one (1) community coordinator and the faculty.</p>
<p>From an initial total of 875 first enrollees, 232 students made to the first batch who graduated on October 22, 2006. The hallmark of achievement of the college is when the first batch got an 82 % passing rate in the Licensure Examination for Nurses, placing the University of the Cordilleras number 9 among the 300 colleges of nursing all over the Philippines and number 2 in CAR. Making it exceptional, is the fact that the University of the Cordilleras - College of Nursing is one of the new schools in the nation that has 100 and above board takers with high rating.</p>
